<h1>Chase's Journal</h1>

<h2>Journal Entry 1 10/2/22</h2>

<p>So far I have spent my time learning about divs, html, css and all the coding stuff. The class has been much more interesting than I thought it would be and I am enjoying myself. The classroom has a very good dynamic to it and everyone gets along which makes a great class and Molly's favorite class. At first it all started as a blur. Then as time went on and especially watching these recent videos, its all coming together. Instead of asking Molly all of my questions about what is wrong or right. I have started to figure them out on my own. </p>

<p>Staring our websites now, pretty confusing to be honest. The cheat sheet is helping me navigate my way through the project. Feels pretty good, the class is having lots of fun which makes it easier and better to learn all these new codes and stuff. Looking forward to seeing how my website will turn out.</p>

<H2>Journal Entry 3 10/18/22</H2>

<p>We were assigned to put an animation into our website. The process to me was a bit confusing but also interesting. The animation I made I didn't like too much so I am considering removing it. However, it was a very cool process to learn and I will definetly consider making another animation in a different part of my website. </p>
