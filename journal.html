<h1>Chase's Journal</h1>

<h2>Journal Entry 1 10/2/22</h2>

<p>So far I have spent my time learning about divs, html, css and all the coding stuff. The class has been much more interesting than I thought it would be and I am enjoying myself. The classroom has a very good dynamic to it and everyone gets along which makes a great class and Molly's favorite class. At first it all started as a blur. Then as time went on and especially watching these recent videos, its all coming together. Instead of asking Molly all of my questions about what is wrong or right. I have started to figure them out on my own. </p>
